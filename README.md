# can.eventstream

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/canjs/can-eventstream.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

`can.eventstream` is a [CanJS](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs) plugin that
provides a simple, generic `EventStream` interface for integrating
[FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)-like
systems into `CanJS`.

When used in tandem with an implementing plugin, such as
[can.bacon](https://github.com/zkat/can.bacon), it results in a fancy new
event binding experience, closely integrated with all the relevant `CanJS` APIs.

`can.eventstream` is
[hosted at Github](http://github.com/zkat/can.eventstream). `can.eventstream` is a
public domain work, dedicated using
[CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Feel free to do
whatever you want with it.

# Quickstart

### Install

`$ npm install can.eventstream`
or
`$ bower install can.eventstream`

Prebuilt releases are included in `dist`. These expect `CanJS` to be either
globally loaded, or available through `CommonJS` or `AMD` modules.

# Documentation

## CanJS

**This interface is only available when an implementing plugin is
  included. `can.eventstream` will not work by itself.**

`can.eventstream` extends the event binding features of `CanJS` so they return
`EventStream`s whenever an event callback is omitted. . It also takes steps to
normalize event information into a single, consistent event object, depending on
the type of event source. For example, all list events, regardless of event
name, have the same structure.

The examples below assume [can.bacon](https://github.com/zkat/can.bacon) has
been included.

### `can.bind.call(this[, event="change"[, callback]])`

Extends `can.bind()` such that if it's called with only one argument (the
event name), or without any arguments, a `Bacon.EventStream` object is
created, instead of binding a callback to the event.

The actual event values sent into the `EventStream` will vary depending on
the observed value.

See http://canjs.com/docs/can.bind.html for documentation on the default
behavior.

#### Example

```javascript
can.bind.call(new can.Map(), "change").map(".value").log();
```

### `can.delegate.call(this, selector[, event="change"[, callback]])`

Extends `can.delegate()` such that if it's called with only one or two
arguments (the selector, and the event name), a `Bacon.EventStream` object is
created, instead of binding a callback to the event.

The actual event values sent into the `EventStream` will vary depending on
the observed value.

See http://canjs.com/docs/can.delegate.html for documentation on the default
behavior.

#### Example

```javascript
can.delegate.call(window, "a", "click").doAction(".preventDefault").log();
```
### `can.unbind.call(eventName | stream[, handler])`

Extends `can.unbind()` such that if it's called with an `EventStream` as the
event and no handler, it unbinds an attached stream from `this`. Otherwise, it
will revert to the default behavior.

This override is primarily for the purpose of undoing the effects
`can.bind[X]FromStream()` family of functions. Once this function is called, the
bound objects will no longer listen for changes from the stream, and the stream
will be garbage collectable once again (since binding in this way forces them to
actually bind and stick around).

See http://canjs.com/docs/can.unbind.html for documentation on the default
behavior.

### `can.compute#bind([event="change"[, callback]])`

Extends the default CanJS behavior of the `can.compute#bind()` method so that
it returns an `EventStream` of new `can.compute` values, if no `callback` is
provided to the `.bind()` call. If the `callback` is present, this method
reverts to the standard behavior of binding an event listener directly.

#### Example

```javascript
var compute = can.compute(1);
compute.bind().log("compute changed");
compute(2);
// -> compute changed 2
```

### `can.Control#on([context=this.element[, selector[, event="change"[, callback]]]])`

Enhances `can.Control#on` (and by extension, `can.Component#events#on`) so it
can be used to listen to event streams in a memory-safe way, according to the
control/component's lifecycle. Since the default method accepts method names,
this overridden method will first check if the possible `callback` is an
existing property, if it's a string, before determining whether to fall back
to the default behavior, or to return an event stream.

See http://canjs.com/docs/can.Control.prototype.on.html

#### Example

```javascript
...
events: {
  inserted: function() {
    this.on(GlobalStreams.specialEvent).log("special event:");
  }
}
...
$("mycomponent").remove() // logs 'special event: \<end\>'
GlobalStreams.specialEvent.push("whatever"); // Nothing happens

// The following are also equivalent:
this.on(scope, "change").log("Scope changed")
this.on(scope).log("Scope changed")
```

### `can.Map#bind([event="change"[, callback]])`

Replaces the default CanJS behavior of the `can.Map#bind()` method with one
that returns an `EventStream` of event objects or values if the `callback`
argument is not provided.

The values in `EventStream` vary depending on the event being listened to.

For named property events, the new value of the property is returned, as-is.

For `"change"` events, `MapChangeEvent` objects are returned, with the
following properties:

```javascript
{
  event: Object // The CanJS event object.
  which: String // They attr/key affected by the event,
  how: "add"|"remove"|"set" // The type of operation,
  value: Any // For "add"/"set" events, the new value. For "remove" events,
                the removed value.
}
```

Note that this object fits the API required for `Bacon.toCanMap`, so the
`EventStream` returned by this function can be piped into a different
`can.Map` to partially or fully synchronise both maps.

Additionally, The events from that `Map` changing can then be piped back into
the original `Map` without causing circularity issues, achieving two-way
binding between both objects. See example.

#### Example

```javascript
// Binding
var map = new can.Map({x:1});
map.bind().log("map changed:");
map.bind("x").log("x property changed:");
map.attr("x", 2);
// map changed: {event: Object, which: "x", "how": "set", value: 2}
// x property changed: 2

// Piping into a different Map
var map1 = new can.Map();
var map2 = map1.bind().toCanMap(new can.Map());
map1.bind().log("map1 changed:");
map2.bind().log("map2 changed:");

map1.attr("x", 1);
// map2 changed: {event: Object, which: "x", "how": "add", value:1}
// map1 changed: {event: Object, which: "x", "how": "add", value:1}
map2.attr("x", 2);
// map1 changed: {event: Object, which: "x", "how": "set", value:2}
// map2 changed: {event: Object, which: "x", "how": "set", value:2}
console.log(map1.attr(), map2.attr());
// {x:2}, {x:2}
```

### `can.List#bind([event="change"[, callback]])`

Replaces the default CanJS behavior of the `can.List#bind()` method with one
that returns an `EventStream` of event objects or values if the `callback`
argument is not provided.

The values in `EventStream` vary depending on the event being listened to.

For named property events, the new value of the property is returned,
as-is. Both numerical properties (indices) and regular Map attrs can be
bound to.

For the `"length"` events, the new length of the array is returned as-is.

The rest of the events, namely `"change"`, `"add"`, `"remove"`, and `"set"`,
either `ListChangeEvent` or `MapChangeEvent` objects are returned from the
stream, depending on whether the modification involves a numerical key.

For events on numerical properties, `ListChangeEvent` objects are returned,
with the following properties:

```javascript
{
  event: Object // The CanJS event object.
  index: Integer // They initial index of the change.
  how: "add"|"remove"|"set" // The type of operation,
  value: Array | Any // For "add" events, an array of added items.
                        For "remove" events, an array of removed items.
                        For "set", the single new value.
}
```

For events on non-numerical properties, `MapChangeEvent` objects are
returned, using the same structure as `can.Map#bind()`:

```javascript
{
  event: Object // The CanJS event object.
  which: String // They attr/key affected by the event,
  how: "add"|"remove"|"set" // The type of operation,
  value: Any // For "add"/"set" events, the new value. For "remove" events,
                the removed value.
}
```

Note that these objects conform to the API required for `Bacon.toCanList` and
`Bacon.toCanMap` respectively, so the `EventStream` returned by this function
can be piped into a different `can.List` or `can.Map` to synchronise both.

Unlike the stream returned by `can.Map#bind()`, this one cannot be used for
two-way binding out of the box, since `add` events will bounce back and forth
infinitely and cause an overflow. One-way binding works fine, though, and can
easily handle lists of different lengths.

### `can.bindComputeFromStream(stream[, compute=can.compute()])`

Returns a `can.compute` whose value changes whenever `stream` has a new value If
a compute is provided, it will be used instead of creating a new one.

### `can.bindMapFromStream(stream[, map=new can.Map()])`

Returns a `can.Map` whose value is managed by a stream of incoming map change
events.

If `map` is provided, it *must* be a `can.Map` instance (or an instance of a
subclass), which will be used instead of creating a new empty `can.Map`.

Two kinds of event objects are accepted:

```javascript
// Modification event. Modifies a single key.
{
  how: "set"|"add"|"remove", // The type of operation.
  which: String, // The key to modify.
  value: Any, // The value to set. Optional for `remove`.
}
```

```javascript
// Replacement event. Uses `.attr()` to replace multiple keys.
{
  how: "replace", // Must be this string.
  value: Object, // Object to replace with.
  removeOthers: Boolean // Passed to `.attr()`. See http://canjs.com/docs/can.Map.prototype.attr.html#sig_map_attr_obj__removeOthers__
}
```

### `can.bindListFromStream(stream[, list=new can.List()])`

Returns a `can.List` whose value is managed by a stream of incoming list
and/or map change events.

If `list` is provided, it *must* be a `can.List` instance, which will be used
instead of creating a new empty instance.

Three kinds of event objects are accepted:

```javascript
// Modification event. Modifies a single index or key.
{
  how: "set"|"add"|"remove", // The type of operation.
  which: String|Integer, // The key to modify.
  value: Any, // The value to set. For "add" on an Integer index, must be an
                 Array-like. Optional for `remove`.
}
```

```javascript
// Replacement event. Calls `.replace()`
{
  how: "replace", // Must be this string.
  value: Array-like, // Array-like to replace contents with.
  removeOthers: Boolean=true (optional) // Whether to keep trailing elements
                                           after value has been applied. If
                                           this argument is provided, the
                                           list will be replaced using
                                           `.attr()`. Otherwise, `.replace()`
                                           will be used. See:
                                           http://canjs.com/docs/can.List.prototype.attr.html#sig_list_attr_elements__replaceCompletely__
}
```

## Plugin API

The API described here must be used by implementor plugins in order to provide
`EventStream`s to `CanJS`. Currently, `can.eventstream` supports only a single
global plugin loaded into an instance of `can`.

In order to implement this API, an object named EventStream must be added to the
`can` namespace. This object can be anything, provided it has the following 4
functions in it.

An example implementation of this plugin using
[bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) is available as
[can.bacon](https://github.com/zkat/can.bacon)

### `can.EventStream.isEventStream(stream)`

Must be implemented by a can.eventstream plugin.

Returns a truthy value if `stream` is a compatible event stream.

### `can.EventStream.bind(context, event, selector)`

Must be implemented by a can.eventstream plugin.

Returns an event stream that will listen to events, using the given `event` and
`selector` parameters.

### `can.EventStream.onValue(stream, callback)`

Must be implemented by a can.eventstream plugin.

Binds `callback` such that it will be called on `stream` values. Callback
invocation mechanics are left to the implementing plugin.

### `can.EventStream.untilStream(stream, until)`

Must be implemented by a can.eventstream plugin.

Returns an event stream that will terminate as soon as a new value becomes
available in the given `until` stream.
